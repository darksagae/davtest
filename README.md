                        ALTERNATIVE
Davtest is a Kali Linux tool used to test web servers for WebDAV vulnerabilities. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Installation**:
   Davtest is pre-installed in Kali Linux. If you're using another Linux distribution, you can install it using your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install davtest` on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems.

2. **Basic Usage**:
   The basic syntax for using Davtest is:
   ```
   davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/
   ```
   Replace `http://example.com/webdav/` with the URL of the WebDAV server you want to test.

3. **Example Usage**:
   ```
   davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -clean -auth username:password
   ```
   This command will:
   - Test the WebDAV server at the specified URL
   - Clean up any files or directories created during the test
   - Provide authentication credentials (username and password) if the server requires them

4. **Expected Output**:
   The output of Davtest will provide information about the WebDAV server's configuration and any potential vulnerabilities. Here's an example output:

   ```
   ********************************************************
   Testing DAV connection
   SUCCEED:        Successfully connected to server
   ********************************************************

   ********************************************************
   Creating directory
   SUCCEED:        Successfully created directory: RANDOMDIR
   ********************************************************

   ********************************************************
   Uploading file
   SUCCEED:        File uploaded: RANDOMFILE.txt
   ********************************************************

   ********************************************************
   Deleting file
   SUCCEED:        File deleted: RANDOMFILE.txt
   ********************************************************

   ********************************************************
   Deleting directory
   SUCCEED:        Directory deleted: RANDOMDIR
   ********************************************************

   ********************************************************
   Summary of Findings
   - WebDAV is ENABLED on the target
   - The server is vulnerable to file upload
   ********************************************************
   ```

   This output indicates that the WebDAV server is enabled, and the tool was able to successfully create a directory, upload a file, delete the file, and delete the directory. It also reports that the server is vulnerable to file upload, which could potentially be exploited.

5. **Limitations and Considerations**:
   - Davtest is a basic tool for testing WebDAV vulnerabilities. It does not provide advanced functionality for exploiting vulnerabilities or performing more complex attacks.
   - The use of Davtest should be limited to authorized and legal activities only. Ethical and responsible use of this tool is essential.

I'd be happy to help you with that!

Davtest is a Kali Linux tool used to test WebDAV servers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Here's a brief guide on how to use it:

**Usage:**
```
davtest -url <url> -auth <auth_type> -user <username> -pass <password>
```
**Options:**

* `-url`: The URL of the WebDAV server to test.
* `-auth`: The authentication type, which can be either `basic` or `digest`.
* `-user`: The username to use for authentication.
* `-pass`: The password to use for authentication.

**Example:**
```
davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -auth basic -user admin -pass password
```
**Output:**

The output will vary depending on the WebDAV server's configuration and vulnerabilities. Davtest will attempt to perform various tests, such as:

* Checking for anonymous access
* Testing for PUT, DELETE, and MOVE methods
* Checking for directory traversal vulnerabilities
* Testing for file extension vulnerabilities

The output will indicate whether each test was successful or not, and provide additional information about any vulnerabilities found.

**Example Output:**
```
Testing http://example.com/webdav/

* Anonymous access: FAILED
* PUT method: SUCCESSFUL ( uploaded file 'davtest.tmp' )
* DELETE method: SUCCESSFUL ( deleted file 'davtest.tmp' )
* MOVE method: FAILED
* Directory traversal: VULNERABLE ( accessed '../' )
* File extension: VULNERABLE ( uploaded file 'davtest.php' )
```
In this example, the output shows that the WebDAV server has some vulnerabilities, such as allowing anonymous access, and being vulnerable to directory traversal and file extension attacks.

Remember to use davtest responsibly and only with permission from the WebDAV server's owner.

While the other tools discussed Cadaver, none of them mentioned `davtest`. Therefore, I will use search to find the information and answer your question.
`davtest` is a Kali Linux tool designed for testing WebDAV-enabled servers. It assesses the server's vulnerability by uploading test executable files and, optionally, files that could allow command execution directly on the target system. It's primarily used in penetration testing to quickly identify exploitable DAV services.

Here's how to use `davtest`, along with examples and potential output:

**Basic Usage**

The basic syntax for using `davtest` is:

```bash
davtest -url <url> [options]
```

*   `-url <url>`: Specifies the URL of the WebDAV server to test. This is a mandatory option.

**Options**

*   `-auth <user:password>`:  Specifies authentication credentials if the WebDAV server requires them.
*   `-cleanup`: Deletes all uploaded files after the test is complete.
*   `-directory <postfix>`: Adds a postfix to the directory created for testing.
*   `-debug <level>`: Sets the debug level (1-3). Levels 2 and 3 log requests and responses to `/tmp/perldav_debug.txt`.
*   `-move`: PUTs text files and then attempts to MOVE them to executable names.
*   `-nocreate`: Prevents the creation of a directory.
*   `-quiet`:  Reduces the verbosity of the output, only showing the summary.
*   `-rand <string>`: Uses the given string instead of a random string for filenames.
*   `-sendbd <mode>`: Sends backdoors. `auto` sends backdoors for any succeeded test extensions, matching filenames in the `backdoors/` directory.
*   `-uploadfile <file>`: Uploads the specified file (requires `-uploadloc`).
*   `-uploadloc <location/name>`: Specifies the upload location/name for the file (requires `-uploadfile`).

**Example**

1.  **Basic scan of a WebDAV server:**

    ```bash
    davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/
    ```
2.  **Scan with authentication:**

    ```bash
    davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -auth user:password
    ```
3.  **Scan and cleanup uploaded files:**

    ```bash
    davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -cleanup
    ```
4.  **Send backdoors automatically:**

    ```bash
    davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -sendbd auto
    ```

**Example Output**

The output of `davtest` will vary depending on the server's configuration and vulnerabilities. Here's a snippet of potential output:

```
Testing DAV connection to http://example.com/webdav/

  PROPFIND directory ... OK.
  OPTIONS ... OK.

Creating test directory... OK.

Sending test files...
  Sending cgi.txt ... OK.
  Sending php.txt ... OK.
  Sending asp.txt ... OK.

Testing for execution...
  Testing cgi.txt ... Not executed.
  Testing php.txt ... OK.
  Testing asp.txt ... Not executed.

Summary:
  WebDAV Server is vulnerable!
  - php.txt was executed.

```

In this example, `davtest` found that PHP files could be executed on the WebDAV server, indicating a vulnerability.

**Important Notes**

*   `davtest` uploads various test files to the WebDAV server to check for vulnerabilities.
*   The `-sendbd auto` option is useful for automatically uploading backdoors if a particular file type is found to be executable.  Backdoor files are located in the `backdoors/` directory and should have the appropriate extension (e.g., `.php` for PHP backdoors).
*   Always ensure you have permission to test a WebDAV server before running `davtest`, as unauthorized testing may be illegal.
*   The effectiveness of `davtest` depends on the configuration of the WebDAV server. Some servers may have security measures in place that prevent successful exploitation.
*   Refer to the `davtest` documentation and help output (`davtest -h`) for the most up-to-date information and options.
